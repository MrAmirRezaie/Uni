Basic description:
These exercises are for the advanced programming course of Dr.Shahrokhzadeh.
In doing this exercise, I tried to replace the file with a script file that I wrote in bash language so that others can receive and read the files more easily.

Enter the program directory with the following command:
    cd /Uni

How to use the bash file:
1. Set basic access to run with the following command:
    sudo chmod +x ./install.sh
2. Run the bash file :
    sudo ./install.sh

After executing the compiled and required packages, the running of the program and the compilation of the files are checked in the terminal.

After the check phase is over, it will ask you to specify the file you want, and after specifying the desired file, it will be compiled and run.
